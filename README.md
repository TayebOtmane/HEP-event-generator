# HEP-event-generator

This is a high Energy Physics event generator toy project. Currently simulates 2 incoming paricles along z axis colliding
and producing 2 outgoing particles in random directions.

The only implemented physics for the moment is conservation of energy and momentum.

The goal is to implement scattering cross section calculations up to higher order corrections, include resummation and jet analysis tools.
